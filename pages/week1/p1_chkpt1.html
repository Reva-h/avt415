            <h3>History of Coffee</h3>
                <p> I am a big fan of coffee and think that it would be interesting to learn more about the history of my favorite beverage.
                    I also think that this topic could lend well to an earthy aesthetic, which I am curious about translating into a digital medium like a website.

            <h3>The effects of social media on political polarization</h3>
                <p> I spent my summer working on an app that aims to use AI to reduce political polarization on social media and the issue has become very important to me.
                    I find it incredibly concerning how social media has so much influence over the way we think, which most people either aren't aware of, or don't care.
                    I'm working on a spin-off computational social science project this semester that will try to quantify viewpoint diversity and argument quality within a
                    set of discussion threads. I care deeply about this issue and think that it would be interesting to visualize the little-known dangers of social media.
                </p>
            <h3>How do language models work?</h3>
                <p> Most of my research has been in natural language processing, which is the field of processing and understanding human "natural" language. However, I still
                    don't seem to fully understand how large language models work, and the more I learn, the more confused I get. I think I would benefit immensely from the 
                    challenge of visually communicating this technically complex topic to a general audience. I also think that many people would be interested to learn the 
                    technology and math behind ChatGPT and other chat bots and I would hope to remove some of the mystery and fear that surround AI. If I'm feeling ambitious, 
                    I think it could be fun (and doable?) to hook up an inference API endpoint to my webpage so that users can interact with a generative AI webpage as a part of 
                    the demo. That may require Javascript skills that I don't have, though.
